## C++ Object oriented Programming

## classes and objects

**Objects** are like the entities in the real world.  
**Classes** are the blueprints of the objects.

> **For example** Toyota made a blueprint (`class`) of cars. By using the blueprint they can build multiple cars (`object`).

A class can be a group of objects.

**Classes** are used as templates, so the developer doesn't need to write the same code multiple times.

---

### Properties and Methods

- **Properties** are the variables that hold data related to the object.  
  Example: In a `Car` class ‚Äî `color`, `model`, `brand`, `speed` are properties.

- **Methods** are functions inside the class that define the behavior of the object.  
  Example: In a `Car` class ‚Äî `startEngine()`, `accelerate()`, `brake()` are methods.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    class class_name{
        // properties


        // methods
    };

    return 0;
}
```

**Example code**

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    // properties or attributes
    string brand;
    string color;
    int year;
    double price;

    // methods or member functions
    string paintCar(car , string newColor){
        color = newColor;
    }
};

int main(){

    car c1; // Kinda like struct.

    c1.brand = "Toyota";
    c1.color = "Red";

    cout << c1.brand;

    return 0;
}
```

Error : What is this `Private` thing ?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
*Proceed to access modifiers*

---

### Access modifiers / Specifiers

Struct is public and class is private by default.

**Private :** Data & methods are accessible `inside class`. (`Default`)

**Public :** Data & methods are accessible `to everyone`.

**Protected :** Data & methods are accessible inside class and to it's derived class.

**Previous code error fix**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    public: // Made the class public.
        string brand;
        string color;
        int year;
        double price;

    // methods or member functions
    string paintCar(car , string newColor){
        color = newColor;
    }
};

int main(){

    car c1; // Kinda like struct.

    c1.brand = "Toyota";
    c1.color = "Red";

    cout << c1.brand;

    return 0;
}
```
> Toyota

Even other classes can access a public class.

**Use of private access modifiers**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    private:
        int insurance_number; // The insurance number shouls be kept private.ü§ê
    public:
        string brand;
        string color;
        int year;
        double price;

    // methods or member functions
    string paintCar(car , string newColor){
        color = newColor;
    }
};

int main(){

    car c1; // Kinda like struct.

    c1.brand = "Toyota";
    c1.color = "Red";
    c1.insurance_number;

    cout << c1.brand;

    return 0;
}
```
> int car::insurance_number' is `private` within this context

**We can set and get the values of a private attribute..**
With the help of a public function.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    private:
        int insurance_number; // The insurance number shouls be kept private.ü§ê
    public:
        string brand;
        string color;
        int year;
        double price;

    // Public functions.
        // setter : Sets the insurance number.
        int setIns(int newIns){
            insurance_number = newIns; // This function is inside the same class . so it can access the private attribute.
        }

        // getter : gets the insurance number.
        int getIns(){
            cout << insurance_number << '\n';
        }
};

int main(){

    car c1; // Kinda like struct.

    c1.setIns(33155);

    c1.getIns(); // Accessed private value.
    return 0;
}
```

**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is wraping up of data and member function in a single unit called `class`.

> so , Encapsulation is the process of making a class.

**Data hiding :** Putting a data or method in private access modifier.

## Constructors

Is an special method that gets ivoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for initialisation .

- Same name as class.
- No return type.
- Only called once (automatically) , at object creation.
- Memory allocation happens when object is called.

---

A class doesn't take up any memory space . But when an object is created , it takes up some space. 

**Constructor example**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    private:
        int insurance_number;
    public:
        car(){ // Constructor
            cout << "This? It's a constructor, bro.\n";
        }
        string brand;
        string color;
        int year;
        double price;

    string paintCar(car , string newColor){
        color = newColor;
    }

    int setIns(int newIns){
        insurance_number = newIns; 
    }

    int getIns(){
        cout << insurance_number << '\n';
    }
};

int main(){

    car c1; 
    car c2; 
    car c3; 

    c1.setIns(33155);
    c1.getIns();

    // Didn't call any method / function here.
    return 0;
}
```
> This? It's a constructor, bro. (still printed this [`constructor`]) for c1
> This? It's a constructor, bro. (still printed this [`constructor`]) for c2
> This? It's a constructor, bro. (still printed this [`constructor`]) for c3
> 33155

Each time an object is created the constructor gets evoked automatically.

**We can assign common values for an object in a constructor**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class car{
    private:
        int insurance_number;
    public:
        car(){ 
            brand = "Toyota"; // Every car will be from toyota.
        }
        string brand;
        string color;
        int year;
        double price;
};

int main(){

    car c1; 
    car c2; 

    // Didn't assign any value. Stull it's printing 'Toyota' twice for c1 and c2.

    cout << c1.brand << '\n';
    cout << c2.brand << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
> Toyota
> Toyota

---
**Note on Scope Resolution Operator (`::`) in C++**

The scope resolution operator `::` in C++ is used to **access something that is outside the current scope**. It helps you tell the compiler exactly where to find a variable, function, or class.

---

**Common Uses:**

1. **Access global variable when there's a local one with the same name:**

```cpp
int x = 10; // global

int main() {
    int x = 5; // local
    cout << ::x; // outputs 10 (global x)
}
```

2. **Define a class function outside the class:**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void sayHello(); // only declared here
};

void MyClass::sayHello() { // defined here using ::
    cout << "Hello from MyClass";
}
```

3. **Access static members of a class:**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    static int count;
};

int A::count = 0; // define static variable outside using ::
```

4. **Use namespaces (like std):**

```cpp
std::cout << "Hey there"; // std is the namespace, cout is inside it
```

---

**Summary:**

* `::` lets you **be specific** about which version of something you want.
* It's used with **global variables**, **class definitions**, **static members**, and **namespaces**.
* Think of it as saying: ‚ÄúHey, I mean *this* one, not the other one.‚Äù

Let me know if you want practice problems on this.


There are 3 types of constructors
1. Non-parameterized constructor.
2. Parameterized constructor.
3. Copy constructor.

### Non-parameterized constructor
```cpp
car(){ 
            cout << "This? It's a constructor, bro.\n";
}
```
### Parameterized constructor
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>

using namespace std;

class student {
    private:

    public:
        student(string n , string sub , string dept){ // parameterised constructor
            name = n;
            subject = sub;
            department = dept;
        }
    
        void display(){
            cout << name << endl;
            cout << subject << endl;
            cout << department << endl;
        }

    string name;
    string subject;
    string department;
};

int main(){
    student s1("Mahmud" , "C++" , "CSE"); // Create an object with parameters.
    s1.display();

    return 0;
}
```
**Constructor overloading**
We can make multiple parameterised constructors with the same name in a class but with different parameters and there won't be any errors.
```cpp
student(string n , string sub , string dept){ // parameterised constructor 1
            name = n;
            subject = sub;
            department = dept;
        }

student(int age, string hobby , string ethnicity , string height){ // parameterised constructor 2
//..... ..... .....
}
```
> Constructor overloading is an example of **Polimorphism** ( We'll discuss about it later )
#### this

**this** is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object.
> `this -> property` is same as `*(this).property`

what if someone codes like this....it's his choice üò†
```cpp
student(string name, string subject , string dept){ // parameterised constructor 1
            name = name;
            subject = subject;
            dept = dept;
        }
```
Which one's object / parameter ?üòï
> `Just assigns the parameter name to itself` ‚Äî the member variable gets ignored. So the actual name inside the object stays uninitialized. üíÄ

Do it like this instead ‚§µÔ∏è
```cpp
class student {
    private:

    public:
        student(string name, string sub , string dept){
            this -> name = name;
            this -> sub = sub;
            this -> dept = dept;
        }
    
        void display(){
            cout << name << endl;
            cout << sub << endl;
            cout << dept << endl;
        }

    string name;
    string sub;
    string dept;
};
```

**üß† So why use the same name , if i could use a different keyword to prevent naming conflicts ?**
Honestly? It‚Äôs all about readability, consistency, and sometimes just developer laziness (aka `efficiency` if you're tryna sound professional üòÖ).

**When the constructor takes a bunch of params, it's kinda satisfying to match them up like this:**
```cpp
Person(string name, int age, string gender) {
    this->name = name;
    this->age = age;
    this->gender = gender;
}
```
Looks clean, easy to match. You instantly know which param belongs to which member.

**Align with pointer :** Put the `name`(parameter) in the address of the `name`(object).


### Copy constructors:

C++ compiler can build default copy constructors or we can make our own custom copy constructor.
**Default copy constructor**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>

using namespace std;

class student {
    private:

    public:
        student(string name, string sub , string dept){ // parameterised constructor
            this -> name = name;
            this -> sub = sub;
            this -> dept = dept;
        }
    
        void display(){
            cout << name << endl;
            cout << sub << endl;
            cout << dept << endl;
        }

    string name;
    string sub;
    string dept;
};

int main(){
    student s1("Mahmud" , "C++" , "CSE"); // Create an object with parameters.
    
    student s2(s1); // We can copy the properties of s1 just by passing s1 in s2.
    // Default copy constructor...copies all properties.
    
    s2.display(); //---> Same output as s1.display();

    return 0;
}
```

**Custom copy constructor**
```cpp
class student {
    private:

    public:
        student(string name, string sub , string dept){
            this -> name = name;
            this -> sub = sub;
            this -> dept = dept;
        }

        //Custom copy constructor
        student(student &original_object){
            cout << "This is a custom copy constructor." << endl;
            this -> name = original_object.name; // Says , "copy the name from the address of the original object".
            // Copies only the name from the original object.
        }
        
    
        void display(){
            cout << name << endl;
            cout << sub << endl;
            cout << dept << endl;
        }

    string name;
    string sub;
    string dept;
};

int main(){
    student s1("Mahmud" , "C++" , "CSE"); // Create an object with parameters.
    
    student s2(s1);     
    s2.display();

    return 0;
}
```
> This is a custom copy constructor.                (Automatically generated)

**There are 2 types of copy while making a copy constructor**
1. Shallow copy.
2. Deep copy.

#### Shallow copy

A **shallow copy** of an object copies all the member values **as they are**, including pointers.
The issue pops up when dynamic memory is involved‚Äîboth objects end up pointing to the **same memory**, which can lead to problems like **double deletion** or **unexpected data changes**.

**Recap : Dynamic memory allocation**
Alright, imagine this:

You're a toddler playing with blocks. You have two toy boxes:

- üß∫ **Stack Box**: It‚Äôs small and already has spots for blocks when you start playing. It‚Äôs fast, but not very flexible.
- üß≥ **Heap Box**: It's bigger and more flexible. You can ask your parents (the computer) for more blocks anytime *while* you‚Äôre playing.

Now, **dynamic memory** is like saying:

> ‚ÄúHey Mom! I don‚Äôt know how many blocks I‚Äôll need yet... Can you give me more *when I ask*?‚Äù

That‚Äôs what the **`new`** keyword does in C++ ‚Äî it asks the computer for space *while* the program is running, not before.

So if you don't know how many toys (data) you're gonna play with until later, you use dynamic memory to be chill and ready for anything.

üë∂üí¨ ‚ÄúGimme moar blockz!‚Äù  
üíª‚ú® ‚ÄúHere you go! From the heap!‚Äù

Wanna see that in toddler-code?

```cpp
int* blocks = new int[5]; // "I need 5 blocks!" at playtime
```

Boom. Dynamic. Just like your energy at bedtime üòÖ

Memory that is allocated after the program
is already compiled & running.
Use the `new` operator to allocate
memory in the heap rather than the stack


Useful when we don't know how much memory
we will need. Makes our programs more flexible,
especially when accepting user input.

```cpp
#include<iostream>    
#include<iomanip>     
#include<ctime>       
#include<cstdlib>   

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int size;

    // Ask user for the number of grades to input
    cin >> size;

    // Dynamically allocate memory to store 'size' number of grades
    char *pGrades = new char[size];

    // Take input for each grade
    for(int i = 0 ; i < size ; i ++){
        cout << "Enter grade no. " << i + 1 << " : ";
        cin >> pGrades[i];
    }

    // Print all the entered grades
    for(int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++){
        cout << pGrades[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Free the dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks****
    delete[] pGrades;

    return 0;
}
```
**üß® What is a Memory Leak?**

A **memory leak** happens when your program grabs memory (using `new`) but **forgets to return it** (using `delete`). That memory stays reserved forever (until the program ends), but it‚Äôs not usable anymore.

Basically:

> You rented a room. You left.  
> But you **never returned the key**, so no one else can use it.  
> That room = wasted memory. üôÉ

---

**üîç Example in Code:**

```cpp
void leakExample() {
    int* p = new int[100];  // You booked 100 rooms üè®
    // forgot to delete[] p;
    // boom üí• memory leak
}
```

Every time that function runs, your system loses a chunk of RAM it can‚Äôt use anymore. Stack that up and your PC starts lagging harder than a 2008 laptop running GTA V üò¨.

---

**üìâ Why It's Bad:**
- Wastes memory (obviously).
- Slows down performance.
- Over time, can crash the program or even the system if it's really bad.
- In long-running programs (like games, servers, or robots), it‚Äôs a big no-no üö´.

---

**‚úÖ How to Avoid It:**
- **Always `delete` what you `new`.**
- Even better: use **smart pointers** like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` in C++. They clean up for you like a good roommate.

---

**TL;DR:**

A **memory leak** is like leaving food in the fridge and forgetting about it. You don‚Äôt eat it, no one else eats it, it just rots there‚Ä¶ forever. üßÄüßÇ

---

#### üîÅ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy (in dynamic memory)

* **Shallow Copy**:
  Copies the **pointer only** ‚Üí both objects point to the **same memory**.
  Any change in one affects the other.

* **Deep Copy**:
  Creates a **new memory block** and copies the **actual value** into it.
  Both objects work independently.

---

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This difference only matters when you're dealing with dynamic memory (using `new`).**
> If there‚Äôs **no dynamic allocation**, shallow copy usually works just fine.

---

**TL;DR:**
Shallow = same address, shared data üíÄ
Deep = new address, cloned data üß†‚úÖ

**Code**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {

public:
    string name;
    double *cgpaPtr; // Pointer to dynamically allocated CGPA

    Student(string name, double cgpa) {
        this->name = name;
        cgpaPtr = new double;      // Allocating memory for CGPA
        *cgpaPtr = cgpa;           // Storing value in that memory
    }

    ~Student() {
        delete cgpaPtr;            // Freeing memory to avoid leaks üíÄ
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name : " << name << endl;
        cout << "CGPA : " << *cgpaPtr << endl;
    }
};

int main() {

    Student s1("Mahmud", 3.35);
    Student s2(s1); // üö® Shallow copy: s2.cgpaPtr points to the same memory as s1.cgpaPtr

    s1.display();

    *(s2.cgpaPtr) = 3.45; 
    // ‚ùó Modifying s2's CGPA actually changes s1's too
    // because both cgpaPtr point to the same memory address (shallow copy issue)

    s1.display(); // Value changed unexpectedly due to shared pointer

    return 0;
}
```
```
Name : Mahmud
CGPA : 3.35

Name : Mahmud
CGPA : 3.45 (cpga changed)
```
When we create `s1`, its CGPA is stored in a memory location using dynamic allocation. But when we copy `s1` into `s2` using a shallow copy, both `s1` and `s2` end up pointing to the **same memory address** for the CGPA. So, if we change `s2`'s CGPA, it actually changes the CGPA of `s1` too ‚Äî because they‚Äôre both using the **same memory**. This is exactly the problem with shallow copies when using dynamic memory: different objects accidentally share the same data, which can cause unexpected changes and bugs.

**This is where deep copy comes in**

#### Deep copy

* In **shallow copy**, the original and the copy both point to the **same memory address**.
  ‚Üí Changing one affects the other.

* In **deep copy**, the original and the copy each point to **different memory addresses**.
  ‚Üí Changing one doesn't affect the other.

**For deep copy we have to make our custom copy constructor first**
```cpp
Student(string name ,double cgpa){
        this -> name = name;
        cgpaPtr = new double;
        *cgpaPtr = cgpa;
    }

// Custom copy consructor (Still shallow copy)
    Student(Student &obj){ // Pointing to the address of the object created in Student class
        this -> name = obj.name;
        this -> cgpaPtr = obj.cgpaPtr;
    }
```

To make it deep copy we have to allocate another dynamic memory for the copy.
```cpp
Student(string name ,double cgpa){
            this -> name = name;
            cgpaPtr = new double;
            *cgpaPtr = cgpa;
        }

        Student(Student &obj){ 
            this -> name = obj.name;
            cgpaPtr = new double; // New memory allocated
            *cgpaPtr = *(obj.cgpaPtr); // This points to the new value at the new address of the new object
        }
```

**Full code**
```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class Student{
    
    public:    
    string name;
    double *cgpaPtr;

        Student(string name ,double cgpa){
            this -> name = name;
            cgpaPtr = new double;
            *cgpaPtr = cgpa;
        }

        Student(Student &obj){ 
            this -> name = obj.name;
            cgpaPtr = new double; // New memory allocated
            *cgpaPtr = *(obj.cgpaPtr);
        }

        ~ Student(){
            delete cgpaPtr;
        }

        void display(){
            cout << "Name : " << name << endl;
            cout << "CGPA : " << *cgpaPtr << endl;
            cout << endl;
        }
};

int main(){

## Destructor
De-allocates a memory
```cpp
~class_name(){
    delete ptr;
}
```
Prevents memory leak

If we allocate a dynamic memory , we must delete it at the end , to prevent memory leak. 

## Inheritence 
When **<font color = "red">properties and member functions</font>** of a **<font color = "yellow">base / parent</font>** class are passed on the **<font color = "cyan">derived / child</font>** class.


```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

// Base class (parent)
class parentClass {
protected:
    string parent_surname; // Protected so child class can directly access
public:
    // Parent constructor that accepts a surname
    parentClass(string parent_surname) {
        cout << "Parent constructor.\n";
        this->parent_surname = parent_surname;
    }
};

// childClass inherits publicly from parentClass
class childClass : public parentClass {
    string firstName;
public:
    // Child constructor calls the parent constructor using initializer list
    childClass(string surName = "Alam") : parentClass(surName) {
        cout << "Child constructor.\n";
    }

    // The child has direct access to parent_surname because it's protected
    void setName() {
        cout << "Enter first name : \n";
        cin >> firstName;
    }

    // Combines child‚Äôs first name with inherited parent surname
    void showName() {
        cout << firstName << " " << parent_surname << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Each child object calls the parent constructor during creation
    childClass child_1, child_2, child_3, child_4;

    child_1.setName();
    child_2.setName();
    child_3.setName();
    child_4.setName();

    child_1.showName();
    child_2.showName();
    child_3.showName();
    child_4.showName();

    return 0;
}
```
**Output**
```Parent constructor.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on <font color = "cyan">different forms</font> or behave in different ways <font color = "cyan">depending on the context</font> in which they are used.

1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Run time polymorphism

### Compile time polymorphism
**1. Constructor overloading**

Constructor overloading means having more than one constructor in a class, but each one has different types or numbers of parameters. It lets you create objects in different ways. For example, you can create a `Student` by just giving a name, or give both name and age ‚Äî both are valid because there are different constructors handling each case. It's like having multiple ways to start the same engine.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class Student{
    public:
        Student(){
            cout << "This is a non-parameterised constructor.\n";
        }

        Student(string name){
            cout << "My name is " << name << "\n";
        }

        Student(string name , int age){
            cout << "Iam " << name << " , Iam " << age << " years old.\n";
        }

        ~Student(){}

};

int main(){

    Student s1 , s2("Mahmud") , s3("Mohaimin" , 18);

    return 0;
}
```
```
This is a non-parameterised constructor.
My name is Mahmud
Iam Mohaimin , Iam 18 years old.
```
The `Student` class has three constructors that print different messages based on how you create an object: if you create a `Student` with no info, it says ‚ÄúThis is a non-parameterised constructor‚Äù; if you provide just a name, it prints ‚ÄúMy name is \[name]‚Äù; and if you give both name and age, it prints ‚ÄúI am \[name], I am \[age] years old.‚Äù This shows how the class handles different inputs by running the matching constructor automatically.

**2. Function overloading**

Function overloading is when you have multiple functions with the same name but different types or numbers of inputs (parameters). This way, you can do similar actions in different ways depending on what information you give. For example, a function called `add` could add two numbers if you give two inputs, or add three numbers if you give three inputs‚Äîboth use the same function name but handle the inputs differently. It‚Äôs like having one command with different flavors.

```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class sum{
    public:
        int add(int a, int b){
            return (a + b);
        }
        int add(int a, int b, int c){
            return (a + b + c);
        }
};

int main(){
    sum s1;
    cout << s1.add(1,2) << "\n";
    cout << s1.add(1,2,3) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```
```

```
**3. Operator overloading**
[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-cpp/)

### Run time polymorphism
1. Function overriding.
2. Virtual function.

**1. Function overridng**

Parent and child both contain the same function with different implimentations.
- The parent class function is called to be overridden

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class parentClass {
    public:
    void show(){
        cout << "Parent class.\n";
    }
};

class childClass : public parentClass {
    public:
    void show(){ // Same function name , different implimentation
        cout << "Child class.\n";
    }
};

int main(){

    parentClass p1;
    p1.show();
    
    childClass c1;
    c1.show();

    return 0;
}
```
```
Parent class.
Child class.
```

**2. Virtual function**
A virtual function is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived class.
- Virtual functions are dynamic in nature
- Defined by the keyword "vitual" inside a base class and are always declared with a base class and overridden in a child class.
- A virtual function is called during runtime.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class parentClass {
    public:
        virtual void show(){
            cout << "Parent class.\n";
        }
};

class childClass : public parentClass {
    public:
        void show(){
            cout << "Child class.\n";
        }
};

int main(){

    parentClass *ptr; // 'ptr' is supposed to store the memory address of an object under 'parentClass'
    childClass c1;

    ptr = &c1; // But 'ptr' is storing the address of c1 , which belongs to childClass.
    // ‚û°Ô∏è Yes, and it's totally allowed. It‚Äôs called: Polymorphism a.k.a. "Treating the child like the parent"

    ptr->show(); // Q. Which one will be called ?

    return 0;
}
```
```
child class 
```
**If we remove `virtual` keyword**
```
parent class
```
When you use a pointer of the base class type (like `parentClass*`) to point to an object, what happens when you call a function depends on two things: **whether the function is marked `virtual`** and **what kind of object the pointer actually points to**.

* If the function **is virtual**, C++ checks the **real type of the object at runtime** (not just the pointer type). **So if the pointer points to a child object**, the child‚Äôs version of the function runs. This is called **runtime polymorphism**.
* If the function **is not virtual**, C++ decides which function to call based on the **pointer‚Äôs type only** at compile time, ignoring the actual object type. So even if the pointer points to a child object, the parent‚Äôs version runs.
* If the pointer points to a **parent object**, whether or not the function is virtual, the parent‚Äôs version runs because the object *is* the parent.
```cpp
 parentClass p1;
    parentClass *ptr; 
    ptr = &p1; // Parent obj is stored

    ptr->show(); // Q. Which one will be called ?
```
```
parent class
```

**In short:**
`virtual` functions let C++ be smart and call the right version based on the real object, but without `virtual`, C++ just calls the parent‚Äôs function because it only looks at the pointer type.

## Abstraction
hiding all unessesary details and showing only the important parts.

some methods of abstraction
- Access specifiers 
- Access classes

**Abstraction using Abstract Classes**

- Abstract classes are used to provide a base class from which other classes can be derived.  
- They cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited. (Instance = object)
- Abstract classes are typically used to define an interface for derived classes.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// üß± Abstract class: acts like a *blueprint* for all shapes.
// It says: "Any class that inherits me MUST draw itself!"
class shapes {
    virtual void drawShape() = 0; // Pure virtual function ‚Üí no body, just a rule.
};

// üéØ Concrete class: builds the actual shape using the blueprint.
class circle : public shapes{
    public:
        void drawShape(){
            cout << "Drawing circle.\n";
        }
};

// üéØ Another concrete class using the same blueprint
class square : public shapes{
    public:
        void drawShape(){
            cout << "Drawing square.\n";
        }
};

int main() {
    square s1;
    s1.drawShape(); // Output: Drawing square.
    return 0;
}
```
```
Drawing square.
```
## Static keyword

* **Static Variables**

  Variables declared as `static` inside a function are created and initialized only once, and they retain their value throughout the program's lifetime.  //in Function

  Static variables inside a class are also created and initialized only once. They are shared among all objects of the class.  //in Class

* **Static Objects**

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class firstClass {
    public:
    void incX(){
        int x = 0;
        cout << x++ << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    firstClass f1;

    f1.incX();
    f1.incX();
    f1.incX();
    f1.incX();
    
   return 0;
}
```

A beginner might think the output would be `0 1 2 3`, but in reality, it‚Äôs `0 0 0 0`.

Why?

Every time the `incX()` function is called, `x` is initialized to 0 at a new memory location, and the previous one gets destroyed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[incX called] --> B[x initialized to 0 - local scope]
    B --> C[Print value of x]
    C --> D[Increment x]
    D --> E[Function ends]
    E --> F[x is destroyed]
    F --> G[incX called again]
    G --> B
```

So, it prints `0` every single time.

This is where `static` saves the day.

```cpp
class firstClass {
    public:
    void incX(){
        static int x = 0; // Static variable
        cout << x++ << endl;
    }
};
```

```
0  
1  
2  
3  
```

Variables declared as `static` inside a function are created and initialized once, and they persist for the **entire lifetime** of the program.  //in Function

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class firstClass {
    public:
    firstClass(){
        cout << "Constructor.\n";
    }
    ~firstClass(){
        cout << "Destructor.\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    if(true){
        firstClass f1;    
    }
    cout << "Program ended.\n";
   return 0;
}
```

```
Constructor.  
Destructor.  
Program ended.
```

Normally, the destructor is called right after the constructor's job is done.
But if the object is declared as `static`...

```cpp
int main() {
    if(true){
        static firstClass f1;    
    }
    cout << "Program ended.\n";
   return 0;
}
```

```
Constructor.  
Program ended.  
Destructor.
```
The destructor is now called **after** the entire program ends.


## Friend keyword (friend class and functions)

A friend in C++ is a function or class that is given **special access to the private and protected members** of another class without being its member or subclass. Declaring a friend allows controlled external access to class internals while keeping encapsulation intact.

### Problem 1: Friend Function Basics

Create a class `Number` that has:

* A private integer variable `value`.
* A constructor that sets `value`.
* A friend function `showValue` that prints the `value` of a `Number` object.

Write the class and the friend function. Then, in `main()`, create a `Number` object with value `42` and call `showValue` on it.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
    int value;
    public:
        Number(int value){
            this->value = value;
        }
        friend void showValue(const Number &obj);
    };

    void showValue(const Number &obj){
        cout << "Value : " << obj.value << endl;
    }
int main() {
    Number n1(42);
    showValue(n1);
   return 0;
}
```

### Problem 2:

Make a class `SecretNumber` with:

* A private integer `secret`.
* A constructor to set `secret`.
* A friend function `doubleSecret` that takes a `SecretNumber` object and returns **twice** the value of `secret`.

In `main()`, create a `SecretNumber` object with value 10, call `doubleSecret` on it, and print the result.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class SecretNumber {
    int secret;
    public:
    SecretNumber(int secret){
        this->secret = secret;
    }

    friend int doubleSecret(const SecretNumber &obj);
};

int doubleSecret(const SecretNumber &obj){
    return (obj.secret * 2);
}

int main() {
    SecretNumber s1(10);
    cout << doubleSecret(s1) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### Problem 3:

Create a class `Score` with:

* A private integer `points`.
* A constructor to initialize `points`.
* A friend function `addBonus` that takes a `Score` object and an integer `bonus`, adds the bonus to the private `points`, and returns the new total (don‚Äôt modify the original object).

In `main()`, make a `Score` object with `50` points, call `addBonus` with bonus `20`, and print the result.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Score {
    int points;
    public:
    Score(int points){
        this->points = points;
    }

    friend int addBonus(const Score &obj , int bonus);
};
int addBonus(const Score &obj , int bonus){
    return obj.points + bonus;
}
int main() {
    Score s1(50);
    cout << addBonus(s1,20) << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```
### Problem 4:

Create two classes:

**Class: `Player`**

* Private `int score`
* Constructor to set score

**Class: `Coach`**

* No data members
* A friend function `boostScore` that takes a `Player` object and returns `score + 10`

> Make `boostScore()` a **friend of Player**, but define it **inside Coach**.

In `main()`, make a `Player` object with score `90`, and use a `Coach` object to call `boostScore()` on it, then print the boosted score.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Player {
    int score;
    public:     
        Player(int score){
            this->score = score;
        }
    friend class Coach;
    // You don't need to declare the function here , by making a friend class you already gave 'Coach' all the access of 'Player'
};

class Coach {
    public:
    int boostScore(const Player &obj){
        return obj.score + 10;
    }
};
int main() {
    Player p1(90);
    Coach c1;
    cout << c1.boostScore(p1);
    
   return 0;
}
```
